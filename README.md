# space-shooters
A project using Pygame.  2 players can play with WASD and ctrl to shoot and the Arrow keys and ctrl to shoot.  This project uses projectiles, moving characters around, handling collisions, loading images and sound effects.  Tutorial by Tech with Tim.  Not my first time making a 2D game, but my first time using Pygame.  I plan to make more.
